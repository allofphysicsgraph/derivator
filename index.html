      <h1>The Derivator</h1>
      <p class="lead">Objective for this project is to write down all known mathematical physics in a way that can be both read by humans and checked by a computer algebra system.</p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="lead">Mathematics / Physics literature suffers to lack of resolution in given explanations.</p>
      <p>Books are written for specialists or students who already have certain knowledge and experience, making content be unavailable to people who want to expand their knowledge into new field of science.</p>
      <p>The way it works currently is specialist literature is written for people working in the field, for everyone else there is popular science literature.</p>
      <h3>How it works?</h3>
      <p>Books as we know them, integrate storage and representation of the knowledge in single place, which results from less advanced technological process of writing materials. We treat those aspects separately, knowledge is stored using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base">knowledge base</a>, in form of XML files, then human readible representation is generated by rendering software, such as one written in scripts of this website.</p>
      <p>This aproach brings several advantages, just few of them are: we could generate more compact materials for advanced users, as well as very detailed and long explanations for amateurs, this can be done by changing configuration of rendering software, unlike now, it requires rewriting entire book from scratch. Another advantage is, in STEM fields, most information is repetitive, thus by translating just few templates we could regenerate entire set of materials in different language.</p>
      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>We are a group of individuals coming from different backgrounds, but our common denominator is we are all interested in creating tools that would improve scientific collaboration and education.</p>
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p class="lead">Starting from here, everything is machine generated from the knowledge base.</p>
